# Agenda Items
## You Serve We Serve (YSWS)
### What is YSWS?
* YSWS is an initiative that for our club, that you (**club member**), will do something (**code**) and we (**the club**) will
provide something in return.

### Proposed idea:
* For the one Julian (**D4LM**) is thinking about is,

**You**(Club Member): Code for at least two meeting days and add up to 1 hour in total coding time.
**We**(Club): Give you stickers sometime during the end of quarter 2 and also provide a starter example project to do.

### Proposed rules:
1. You need to code at least 1 hour in total and must be for at least two meetings
2. You **must** be coding and **not** playing video games or using your phone
3. If you are found to have cheated in some way, either fake coding, like using [hackertype](https://hackertyper.com/)
4. Use of generative AI is prohibited
5. Code must be shared to the club through GitHub and for non-simplex projects, documentation must be provided.
6. Project cannot be a fork of your own project or somebody else's project
7. LHSCC has the sole right and authority to not serve you if not enough members are commited to the initiative or they
have found you have cheated or manipulated the initiative in some way

### Things we need to for the YSWS:
- [ ] Give it a name
- [ ] Create a docs category where main page contains rules and other items
- [ ] Get more members, create specific posters for this
- [ ] Other items
