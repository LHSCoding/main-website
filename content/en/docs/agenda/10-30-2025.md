# Agenda Items
## New Discord Server
### Goals:
 - [ ] Migrate LHSCC Discord Bot to that Discord Server
 - [ ] Migrate new logo (maybe color scheme) to Discord Server
 - [ ] Add new Discord invite link to website
## Posters:
- [ ] If Gianni or some other people are willing to help, the posters are at home currently and I need someone to post 
them around the school.
- [ ] Creating our own posters (we could use HackClub posters as an example)

## YSWS
* Probably will still happen, but need **all of you** to help advertise the event
* If there is enough interest from **all of you** than I will create the rules, and we can work on it as referenced on 
our [previous agenda](https://largo.hackclub.com/docs/agenda/10-16-2025/)
